# black_hornet_nano_update
Project to update the Black Hornet Nano Mod for Arma 3 to current v1.84 standards
Modlink: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331997787

This will be what I hope is the start of a string of small updates and upgrades to mods that have been left languishing on the sidelines of content for Arma 3 over the last few years. We all know of some mod or other that could use a generous update to become relevant again to the community at large. It is my wish to be like the island of misfit toys from Rudolph the Red Nosed reindeer movie fame and restore a few of these types of mods to their rightful place.
